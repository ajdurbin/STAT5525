Research Questions

- Can we identify those who go to lunch together?
- Look at web traffic and cross list with employment dates
- look at device info and employment dates to see if this correlates with stealing data
- create new attrition variable. we have approximate start and end dates, we can couple this with their web traffic, logon/logoff traffic, device traffic to see if they were fired. additionally we can say if they were promoted or not also.
- crosslist user job with what we should expect, will a janitor have a usb drive? probably not. 
- can filter attrition and promotion by job titles too
