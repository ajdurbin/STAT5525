we looked at the file information and looked for those with negative sentiment.
we searched for malicious keywords such as malware/virus/etc. The IT
administrators had a higher attrition rate than other users, over 50%. We first
searched for emails with extremely negative sentiment and looked closer at
these messages and from employees to superisors and visa versa. This way we
could almost detect some disciplanary actions or things of that nature. We
initially found several IT administrators sending very negative emails to
supervisors complaining about working after-hours or holidays. Most happen
Thursday mornings. There are usually two emails from the employee to the
supervisor and two replies from the supervisor. Later near end of business the
IT admin downloads a keylogger file. After the supervisor leaves, the it admin
logs onto the supervisor machine a little after business hours presumably to
extract the keylogging exe file onto the supervisor machine. There were only
two cases of the it admins extracting the keylogging to machines other than
supervisors. The next day the sysadmins have a regular working day before
logging onto the supervisor machines one more time, probably to extract the
keylogs before leaving. Each sysadmin appears to have a normal working day on
their last day. 7/8 have a single supervisor that they are performing this on.
