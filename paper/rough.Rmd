# Introduction

Companies with many employees face challenges monitoring and evaluating the behavior of their employees. By utilizing data collected from employees, such as web traffic, email contents, file contents, and logon information, a company can expect to gain valuable insight into the the potential for employee attrition. Predicting employee attrition is a mulifaceted issue, involving behavior both inside and outside the office. Using all available information for both ACME and DTAA, variables to predict employee attrition were created and modeled using various classification techniques. In addition to these models, both data sets were searched for signs of unscrupulous behavior such as spam, data theft, or personal conflict. These are traits of substandard employees. By integrating these findings within and across company information, some interesting trends and important variables emerged that each company can find useful to monitor employee activity and ensure quality work.
